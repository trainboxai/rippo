We love pull requests! If you want to contribute code, please follow these steps:

1.  **Fork the repository:** Create your own copy of the project on GitHub.

3.  **Make your changes:** Implement your feature or bug fix.
4.  **Test your changes:** Ensure your changes don't break existing functionality (adding tests for new features is highly encouraged!).
5.  **Commit your changes:** Write clear, concise commit messages.

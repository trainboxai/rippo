  "efficiency": {
    "score": 65,
    "summary": "The code audit reveals an unused state variable in the 'Header' component, indicating a minor area of inefficiency.  Additionally, hardcoded shape data in 'StylizedImage' could be externalized for better organization and flexibility.  "

  "documentation": {
    "score": 50,
    "summary": "The codebase relies heavily on inline comments and lacks docstrings for functions and classes. The presence of JSDoc-style comments for components like 'TextInput' and 'RadioInput' is positive. More comprehensive documentation would improve overall understandability. "

    "score": 65,
    "summary": "The code audit highlighted valid efficiency concerns. The service worker's caching strategy could be optimized, and the 'commit-push.sh' script's build process might be streamlined. Addressing these points would enhance performance."

  "documentation": {
    "score": 45,
    "summary": "The code lacks comprehensive documentation. While basic comments exist, adding docstrings to functions, particularly in reusable components like those in 'pages/index.vue', would significantly improve clarity and maintainability."
